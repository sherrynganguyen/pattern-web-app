## Obstacles

The app works properly with the a random number from website. However, I have concern when the big number was sent back. This cause the long runtim for my current app (n! runtime). At this moment, the app could run to the value of 999.

May refactor using Datatable to render the data as well as short runtime when there is no need to render all the data as one.

Concern about the UI when the large pattern was generated. How to display the width
